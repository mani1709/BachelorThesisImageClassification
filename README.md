# BachelorThesisImageClassification
Classification part of the Bachelor thesis

This repository contains all the files needed to setup and recreate the image classifiers of my bachelor thesis.

Setup.ipynb and environment.yml are used to setup the environment needed, this is described in detail in the bachelor thesis.

HandGestureRecognizerBinary.ipynb is the binary classifier (handExists or handNotExisting)

HandGestureRecognizerMultipleGestures.ipynb is the multi class gesture classifier (5 different handposes)

ParameterTesting.ipynb shows how different parameters change the accuracy (takes 45 minutes on my GPU, therefore i provided my output in the file as text)
